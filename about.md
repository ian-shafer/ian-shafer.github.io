  This blog focuses on small to medium size custom software development.
</p>

I am technical co-founder of two startups (Anthology and Yabbly) and a software
engineer with over a decade of experience building small to medium sized web applications.

I have built my career around being able to quickly deploy complex applications that support
current and future business needs.

Over time, I've found several philosophies that drive how I work

* Smaller is better
* Choose the right tool for the current problem
* Build up, don't whittle down
* Choose your tools and frameworks carefully
* It's often better to roll your own
